# Choose Your Own Adventure: Dorian Gray Edition

##### *My English (ENG3U3) creative project*

### Medium
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ren'Py Visual Novel Engine.

### Details
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have chosen to analyze 
several turning points in the novel for Dorian (e.g. going 
into the garden with Lord Henry, going to the theatre with 
Lord Henry instead of going to Basil, being mean to Sybil, 
letting Basil take The Painting, reading the yellow book, 
killing Basil, telling James the truth, stabbing The 
Painting, etc.) and to come up with alternate events.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dorian Gray is the 
driving character for this novel and thus his choices 
create the plot. Pointing out the turning points in the 
plot and analyzing them, as well as suggesting alternatives 
if the event was not to occur, provides insight into the 
things that shaped Dorian. It also allows for extrapolation 
of what would happen if these events were not to occur and 
just how different Dorian would be. 

### Instructions
* Download [Choose Your Own Adventure: Dorian Gray Edition](https://github.com/marinasemen0va/ChooseYourOwnAdventureDorianGrayEdition/archive/master.zip).
* Unzip the downloaded archive file.
* Within the ```ChooseYourOwnAdventureDorianGrayEdition-master``` folder there should be a folder called ```Choose Your Own Adventure Dorian Gray Edition``` and a ```README.md``` file. Delete the ```README.md``` file.
* If Ren'Py is already installed, run the application. If it is not, head down to the ```Ren'Py Installation``` list of instructions below.
* Once the application is running, head to ```preferences``` (bottom right).
* For the game to show up in the projects list, and for it to be able to be 
launched, it must be in the ```Projects Directory```, which is defined in 
preferences.
* Set the ```Project Directory``` to where ```ChooseYourOwnAdventureDorianGrayEdition-master``` 
is located. The resulting path should be something like ```..\ChooseYourOwnAdventureDorianGrayEdition-master```.
* Once the directory is set, click ```Return``` to head back to the projects list.
* ```Choose Your Own Adventure Dorian Gray Edition``` should now appear in the list. Select it and click ```Launch Project```.
* Enjoy :) - *marina*.
